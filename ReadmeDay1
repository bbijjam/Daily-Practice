what conclusions can be made about the model based on the results
Training Error (MSE): 39712.5251421438
R-squared: 0.7764580564644874

 Conclusions:
 1. Relatively Good Fit: The R-squared value of 0.776 indicates that the linear regression model 
  explains approximately 77.6% of the variance in the total bedrooms based on the population. This suggests a relatively good fit to the training data.
 2. Moderate Training Error: The MSE of 39712.53 is a moderate training error. It implies that on average, 
  the model's predictions for the total bedrooms are off by the square root of this value (around 199.28). 
 3. Potential for Improvement: While the model shows a decent fit, there's room for potential improvement. 
  Further analysis could explore the inclusion of additional features or consider more complex model types to reduce the training error and improve the R-squared value.
 4. No Clear Overfitting or Underfitting: The combination of a moderate training error and a reasonably good R-squared value 
  suggests that the model is not overly overfitting or underfitting the data. It's capturing the underlying relationship between population and total bedrooms to a reasonable extent. 
 5. Further Validation Needed: However, it's crucial to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data (validation or test set) 
  to confirm that it generalizes well and isn't overfitting the training data. Without this validation, the conclusion about the model's ability to generalize to new data remains uncertain.
 
 In summary: The model provides a decent representation of the relationship between population and total bedrooms, 
  but further evaluation and potential refinements might lead to an even better model.
